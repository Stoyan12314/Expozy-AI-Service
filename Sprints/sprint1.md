# Sprint S01 — Orientation & Requirements
**Period:** 17.11.2025 to 30.11.2025  
**Sprint issue:** #3  
**Epic focus:** Management + Analysis

## Sprint goal
Company onboarding, EXPOZY/API exploration, stakeholder interviews, initial requirements gathering, finalize project plan.

## Planned backlog items
- Project onboarding and alignment with StudioWEB.BG stakeholders
- Explore EXPOZY storefront framework and API conventions
- Gather initial requirements and success criteria
- Draft and approve project plan
- Start risk analysis draft
- Create initial epics/sprint structure in GitHub

## Work performed (implementation / actions)
- Onboarded with the company and clarified the problem statement: generate EXPOZY pages from natural language.
- Reviewed EXPOZY storefront architecture at a high level (Alpine.js attribute-driven runtime, Tailwind utility classes, API-driven data loading).
- Collected initial requirements and constraints (EU/GDPR considerations, “render-or-fail” structured output requirement, low upfront cost constraint).
- Set up GitHub repository and created initial backlog structure (epics + sprint containers).
- Drafted the project plan and aligned it with mentor/stakeholders.
- Started an initial risk list.

## Deliverables completed
- Signed/approved project plan
- Initial list of epics/sprint plan in GitHub
- Risk analysis draft (initial risks captured)

## Definition of Done check
- [x] Project plan approved by mentor/stakeholders 
- [x] stakeholder interview completed 
- [x] EXPOZY framework explored 

## Review: what changed and why
- Confirmed that EXPOZY’s architecture requires a strict structured contract (template JSON) + deterministic validation/sanitization before rendering/preview.
- Confirmed that “traditional template/scaffolding only” approaches are insufficient due to free-form natural language input and combinatorial layout complexity.

## Retrospective
### What went well
- Fast alignment on scope and constraints.


### What can be improved
- Start writing sprint notes immediately after each sprint.
- Make requirements measurable earlier.

### Actions for next sprint
- Convert findings into a structured research plan (criteria and evaluation framework).
- Expand risk register with mitigations and owners.

## Evidence to attach 
- Key files: project plan, initial risk draft
- Issue links: #3
- Commits: (add commit hashes that added/updated the plan/risk/backlog)
